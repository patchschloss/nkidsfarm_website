We have been living in Dexter, MI since 2009 on our 24 acre farm. We have 9 kids: Mary, Patrick, Joe, John, Ruth, Jacob, Peter, Martha. We work as a team to raise animals on pasture. We're especially proud of our flock of Polypay sheep, flocks of hens and meat birds, and sounder of pigs. Most of these animals are available throughout the year to feed our family and yours! Feel free to explore our website and reach out to us if you have any questions.
